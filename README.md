# Unsupervised Named Entity Recognition on Clinical Trial Interventions using BERT and BERN2

## Summary
This project aims to extract valuable insights from the vast unstructured data in clinical trial
repositories by developing a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. Without labeled datasets
for supervised learning, the model will specialize in identifying and labeling intervention names,
focusing particularly on extracting meaningful entities such as drug names from free text
intervention names retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov (ctgov).
