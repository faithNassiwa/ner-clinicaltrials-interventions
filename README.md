# SemiSupervised Named Entity Recognition on Clinical Trial Interventions using BERT

## Summary
This project aims to extract valuable insights from the vast unstructured data in clinical trial
repositories by leveraging a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model(BERN2) to label the dataset
for supervised learning which will then be used to fine-tune the BioBERT model to classify the free intervention names text as either containing a drug name or not. The
intervention names were retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov (ctgov).
