# SemiSupervised Named Entity Recognition on Clinical Trial Interventions using BERT

## Summary
The project aims to enhance the extraction of insights from clinical trial data by developing a supervised learning model. The approach involves using BERN2, a Named Entity Recognition model, to label clinical intervention names from ClinicalTrials.gov, and subsequently fine-tuning the BioBERT model for text classification to identify whether free text intervention names contain a drug name.
